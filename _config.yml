  As a master's student in Data Science and Geospatial Data Science, 
  I am passionate about protecting the environment and reducing carbon emissions through the application of what I learned. 
  With skills in spatial analysis and data science, 
  I am proficient in ArcGIS Pro, R, Python, SQL, and Tableau.

  I am currently working as a research assistant at the Erb Institute, University of Michigan, 
  where I clean, manipulate, and analyze carbon emission data. 
  My capstone project involves conducting spatial analysis for a Marine Pumped HydroElectric Storage technique, 
  which includes mapping resource potential and assisting with site selection for a pilot project in Hawaii.

  I am actively seeking full time job opportunity of data analyst or business intelligence. 
  I hope to blend my knowledge in geospatial data science and data science to make a difference.
